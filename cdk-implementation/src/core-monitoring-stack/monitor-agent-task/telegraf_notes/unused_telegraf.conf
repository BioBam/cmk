# Telegraf Configuration
#
# Telegraf is entirely plugin driven. All metrics are gathered from the
# declared inputs, and sent to the declared outputs.
#
# Plugins must be declared in here to be active.
# To deactivate a plugin, comment out the name and any variables.
#
# Use 'telegraf -config telegraf.conf -test' to see what metrics a config
# file would generate.
#
# Environment variables can be used anywhere in this config file, simply surround
# them with ${}. For strings the variable must be within quotes (ie, "${STR_VAR}"),
# for numbers and booleans they should be plain (ie, ${INT_VAR}, ${BOOL_VAR})

# Configuration for telegraf agent
[agent]
  ## Default data collection interval for all inputs
  interval = "10s"
  ## Rounds collection interval to 'interval'
  ## ie, if interval="10s" then always collect on :00, :10, :20, etc.
  round_interval = true

  ## Telegraf will send metrics to outputs in batches of at most
  ## metric_batch_size metrics.
  ## This controls the size of writes that Telegraf sends to output plugins.
  metric_batch_size = 1000

  ## Maximum number of unwritten metrics per output.  Increasing this value
  ## allows for longer periods of output downtime without dropping metrics at the
  ## cost of higher maximum memory usage.
  metric_buffer_limit = 10000

  ## Collection jitter is used to jitter the collection by a random amount.
  ## Each plugin will sleep for a random time within jitter before collecting.
  ## This can be used to avoid many plugins querying things like sysfs at the
  ## same time, which can have a measurable effect on the system.
  collection_jitter = "0s"

  ## Collection offset is used to shift the collection by the given amount.
  ## This can be be used to avoid many plugins querying constraint devices
  ## at the same time by manually scheduling them in time.
  # collection_offset = "0s"

  ## Default flushing interval for all outputs. Maximum flush_interval will be
  ## flush_interval + flush_jitter
  flush_interval = "10s"
  ## Jitter the flush interval by a random amount. This is primarily to avoid
  ## large write spikes for users running a large number of telegraf instances.
  ## ie, a jitter of 5s and interval 10s means flushes will happen every 10-15s
  flush_jitter = "5s"

  ## Collected metrics are rounded to the precision specified. Precision is
  ## specified as an interval with an integer + unit (e.g. 0s, 10ms, 2us, 4s).
  ## Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "Âµs"), "ms", "s".
  ##
  ## By default or when set to "0s", precision will be set to the same
  ## timestamp order as the collection interval, with the maximum being 1s:
  ##   ie, when interval = "10s", precision will be "1s"
  ##       when interval = "250ms", precision will be "1ms"
  ##
  ## Precision will NOT be used for service inputs. It is up to each individual
  ## service input to set the timestamp at the appropriate precision.
  precision = "0s"

  ## Log at debug level.
  # debug = false
  ## Log only error level messages.
  # quiet = false

  ## Log target controls the destination for logs and can be one of "file",
  ## "stderr" or, on Windows, "eventlog".  When set to "file", the output file
  ## is determined by the "logfile" setting.
  # logtarget = "file"

  ## Name of the file to be logged to when using the "file" logtarget.  If set to
  ## the empty string then logs are written to stderr.
  # logfile = ""

  ## The logfile will be rotated after the time interval specified.  When set
  ## to 0 no time based rotation is performed.  Logs are rotated only when
  ## written to, if there is no log activity rotation may be delayed.
  # logfile_rotation_interval = "0h"

  ## The logfile will be rotated when it becomes larger than the specified
  ## size.  When set to 0 no size based rotation is performed.
  # logfile_rotation_max_size = "0MB"

  ## Maximum number of rotated archives to keep, any older logs are deleted.
  ## If set to -1, no archives are removed.
  # logfile_rotation_max_archives = 5

  ## Pick a timezone to use when logging or type 'local' for local time.
  ## Example: America/Chicago
  # log_with_timezone = ""

  ## Override default hostname, if empty use os.Hostname()
  hostname = "${INSTANCE_ID}"

  ## If set to true, do no set the "host" tag in the telegraf agent.
  omit_hostname = false

  ## Method of translating SNMP objects. Can be "netsnmp" which
  ## translates by calling external programs snmptranslate and snmptable,
  ## or "gosmi" which translates using the built-in gosmi library.
  # snmp_translator = "netsnmp"

  perdevice = false

  ## Specifies for which classes a per-device metric should be issued
  ## Possible values are 'cpu' (cpu0, cpu1, ...), 'blkio' (8:0, 8:1, ...) and 'network' (eth0, eth1, ...)
  ## Please note that this setting has no effect if 'perdevice' is set to 'true'
  perdevice_include = []

  ## Whether to report for each container total blkio and network stats or not.
  ## Usage of this setting is discouraged since it will be deprecated in favor of 'total_include'.
  ## Default value is 'false' for backwards compatibility, please set it to 'true' so that 'total_include' setting
  ## is honored.
  total = true

  ## Specifies for which classes a total metric should be issued. Total is an aggregated of the 'perdevice' values.
  ## Possible values are 'cpu', 'blkio' and 'network'
  ## Total 'cpu' is reported directly by Docker daemon, and 'network' and 'blkio' totals are aggregated by this plugin.
  ## Please note that this setting has no effect if 'total' is set to 'false'

  ## 2) Assumed credentials via STS if role_arn is specified
  ## 3) explicit credentials from 'access_key' and 'secret_key'

  ## Timestream database where the metrics will be inserted.
  ## The database must exist prior to starting Telegraf.
  database_name = "metricsDB"

  ## Specifies if the plugin should describe the Timestream database upon starting
  ## to validate if it has access necessary permissions, connection, etc., as a safety check.
  ## If the describe operation fails, the plugin will not start
  ## and therefore the Telegraf agent will not start.
  describe_database_on_start = false

  ## The mapping mode specifies how Telegraf records are represented in Timestream.
  ## Valid values are: single-table, multi-table.
  ## For example, consider the following data in line protocol format:
  ## weather,location=us-midwest,season=summer temperature=82,humidity=71 1465839830100400200
  ## airquality,location=us-west no2=5,pm25=16 1465839830100400200
  ## where weather and airquality are the measurement names, location and season are tags,
  ## and temperature, humidity, no2, pm25 are fields.
  ## In multi-table mode:
  ##  - first line will be ingested to table named weather
  ##  - second line will be ingested to table named airquality
  ##  - the tags will be represented as dimensions
  ##  - first table (weather) will have two records:
  ##      one with measurement name equals to temperature,
  ##      another with measurement name equals to humidity
  ##  - second table (airquality) will have two records:
  ##      one with measurement name equals to no2,
  ##      another with measurement name equals to pm25
  ##  - the Timestream tables from the example will look like this:
  ##      TABLE "weather":
  ##        time | location | season | measure_name | measure_value::bigint
  ##        2016-06-13 17:43:50 | us-midwest | summer | temperature | 82
  ##        2016-06-13 17:43:50 | us-midwest | summer | humidity | 71
  ##      TABLE "airquality":
  ##        time | location | measure_name | measure_value::bigint
  ##        2016-06-13 17:43:50 | us-west | no2 | 5
  ##        2016-06-13 17:43:50 | us-west | pm25 | 16
  ## In single-table mode:
  ##  - the data will be ingested to a single table, which name will be valueOf(single_table_name)
  ##  - measurement name will stored in dimension named valueOf(single_table_dimension_name_for_telegraf_measurement_name)
  ##  - location and season will be represented as dimensions
  ##  - temperature, humidity, no2, pm25 will be represented as measurement name
  ##  - the Timestream table from the example will look like this:
  ##      Assuming:
  ##        - single_table_name = "my_readings"
  ##        - single_table_dimension_name_for_telegraf_measurement_name = "namespace"
  ##      TABLE "my_readings":
  ##        time | location | season | namespace | measure_name | measure_value::bigint
  ##        2016-06-13 17:43:50 | us-midwest | summer | weather | temperature | 82
  ##        2016-06-13 17:43:50 | us-midwest | summer | weather | humidity | 71
  ##        2016-06-13 17:43:50 | us-west | NULL | airquality | no2 | 5
  ##        2016-06-13 17:43:50 | us-west | NULL | airquality | pm25 | 16
